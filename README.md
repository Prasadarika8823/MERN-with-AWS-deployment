MERN Stack Website Development

## Key Objectives:
1. Create a slick web app using a RESTful web API.
2. Secure things with an authentication protocol for different user levels.
3. Be mobile-friendly and browser-compatible.
4. Don't forget the security and privacy policies.

## Features to Knock Out:
- Account creation with local authentication (email, password, nickname).
- Limited perks for non-logged-in users.
- Hero search with soft-matching and nifty extras.
- Lists of public hero lists (with ratings) for everyone to see.
- Authenticated users can create and manage their hero lists.
- Admin superpowers to manage users, reviews, and copyright stuff.

## API and Tech Stack:
- Node.js for the backend.
- Front-end framework of choice: React
- Keep it clean, modular, and easily extensible.

# Deploying My Website on AWS: A Step-by-Step
Greetings, fellow engineering pals! ðŸ‘‹ As a third-year student navigating the AWS landscape, let me share my journey on uploading my website to an AWS server. Here's a chill summary:

## One-time Setup:
1. **Getting AWS Academy Access:**
   - I hit the "Get Started" button in the email invitation.
   - Created or logged into my Canvas account.
   - Shot an email to the instructor when no invite arrived.
   - Set up my Canvas account.

## Logging into AWS Academy:
1. Headed to [AWS Academy](https://awsacademy.instructure.com).
2. Clicked on my course, hit up the "Modules" section.
3. Launched the AWS Academy Learner Lab.
4. Clicked "Start Lab," patiently waited for the green AWS light.
5. Downloaded the SSH key from "AWS Details."
6. Clicked "AWS ðŸŸ¢" to open the AWS console.

## Web Server Setup on AWS:
### Step 1: Setting Up the Server (One-time setup)
1. Fired up the AWS Management Console.
2. Launched an instance, stuck with Amazon Linux.
3. Named my instance, kept things default, allowed SSH, HTTPS, and HTTP in the security group.
4. Clicked "Launch instance" and chilled till it turned "Running."
5. Copied the "Public IPv4 DNS" from the instance details.

### Step 2: My Journey In
1. Returned to AWS Academy, tapped into "Readme," and slid into the "SSH Access" link.

### Step 3: Rocking Updates and Nginx
1. After login, I went for the software update with `sudo yum update`.
2. Threw in Nginx with `sudo yum install nginx`.
3. Popped open the browser, tossed in the server name - got the expected timeout.
4. Sprinkled some magic - `sudo systemctl enable nginx` and `sudo systemctl start nginx`.
5. Refreshed the browser - Boom! "Welcome to nginx!"

### Step 4: My Websiteâ€™s Grand Entrance
1. Dived into Nginx config with `sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.
2. Switched "root /usr/share/nginx/html;" to "root /var/www/webtech/html;".
3. Saved, crafted necessary folders.
4. Checked permissions, poured in my HTML, and hit Nginx with a restart.
